# odin-recipes

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I aim to showcase my grasp of essential HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and hyperlinks. As well as,
to show commitment to properly document and write commit messages.
