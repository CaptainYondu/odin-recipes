            <li>1 Teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup warm water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>18 Ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>1 Small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons ice-cold water</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup. </li>
            <li>Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While dough is resting, make filling:</li>
            <li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.</li>
            <li>Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface</li>
            <li>Keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out</li>
            <li>Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter.</li>
            <li>Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent.</li>
            <li>Join the ends and pinch them together.</li>
            <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
            <li>Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni until they float to the top, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Continue cooking for 3-5 more minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
